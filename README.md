## Deployment

Primary target is Cloudflare Pages.

- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `dist`

## Bilingual update policy

- Every meaningful content or UI change in English must be mirrored in French in the same update, unless explicitly deferred.
- If one language is temporarily missing a change, leave a clear note and follow up immediately.

## Contributing

- Open an issue for bugs, regressions, or content/data concerns.
- Keep changes narrow and explicit.
- Preserve the archive tone: content-first, minimal UI noise, transparent methods.
- Maintain EN/FR parity for user-facing changes.
- For data corrections, publish a new correction entry instead of silently rewriting the original.
